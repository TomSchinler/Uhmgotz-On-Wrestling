            Chris Schinler has been a fan of Pro Wrestling since his older brother introduced him to it in the late 80’s.
            A fan of mostly the WWE, Chris has put an emphasis on the great workers of the world’s largest promotion,
            more so than the biggest draws. As the Uhmgotz on Wrestling musical engineer, Chris’s masterpieces can be heard on
            every video, as well as being in front of the camera producing some of the sites most memorable moments. Chris is also
            Tommy Uhmgotz biggest heel, constantly providing compelling arguments and riveting conversations that test Tommy’s
            wrestling IQ. A musician by trade, Chris also has aspirations to one day work for himself as a CPA.
